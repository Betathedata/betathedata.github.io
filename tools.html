<h1>Beta's tools and stuff</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my tools website, this is where I will put downloads to semi-useful things that I have made. Please do not re-host anything on this site. I'm not really one to moan about it but if you do use any of the tools please credit me in the project that you use it in or just simply link to this page, it helps a lot :)</p>
<p>Most of the tools on this page are probably made using <a href="http://zipkrowd.com/tools.htm#cbp">CBP</a> (Command block parser, go check it out!)</p>

<h2>Level to Scoreboard</h2>
<p>This is a tool that converts the players XP Level to a scoreboard value. There are 3 different versions of this schematic, each one generates the command blocks to set the players score on a scoreboard called Levels equal to the Levels of XP that they have.</p>
<p>Video</p>
<p>This video explains how to use the schematic that you import into your world or you can just look at it, it's really simple.</p>

<h3>Schematics</h3>
<p>If you for some reason need up to a bajillion levels, I'd be happy to make new ones on Request.</p>
<p><a href="ToolsRes/Level to Scoreboard/Levels50.schematic">Up to 50 Levels</a></p>
<p><a href="ToolsRes/Level to Scoreboard/Levels100.schematic">Up to 100 Levels</a></p>
<p><a href="ToolsRes/Level to Scoreboard/Levels250.schematic">Up to 250 Levels</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need it the other way around (Scoreboard number to XP) then check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSvcxrfECc0">video by CrushedPixel</a> where he explains how it's possible.</p>
